[Number of Islands - LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-islands/description/) - medium
## Question
>Given an `m x n` 2D binary grid `grid` which represents a map of `'1'`s (land) and `'0'`s (water), return _the number of islands_.
>An **island** is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.
>
>**Example 1:**
>>**Input:** grid = [
>> `["1","1","1","1","0"],`
>> `["1","1","0","1","0"],`
>> `["1","1","0","0","0"],`
>> `["0","0","0","0","0"]`
>> ]
>> **Output:** 1

## Goal:
Find new island.

## Logic:
1. Loop through each cell in the grid by using nested loop for rows and columns
2. If a cell is `1`(unvisited land)
	1. Find new island `1`, `count += 1`
	2. Call DFS mark all connected land as visited
3. DFS function:
	- explore 4 directions
	- if a neighbor is `1`, mark as `-1`  in place, continue DFS
## Code:
```python
class Solution:
    def numIslands(self, grid: List[List[str]]) -> int:
        if not matrix:
            return 0

        count = 0
        for row in range(len(grid)):
            for col in range(len(grid[0])):
                num = grid[row][col]
                if num == '1':
                    count += 1
                    self.dfs(row, col, grid)
        return count
    
    def dfs(self, row, col, grid):
        grid[row][col] = '-1'
        dirs = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, 1), (0, -1)]
        for d in dirs:
            new_row = row + d[0]
            new_col = col + d[1]
            if self.within_bound(new_row, new_col, grid) and grid[new_row][new_col] == '1':
                self.dfs(new_row, new_col, grid)

    def within_bound(self, row, col, grid):
        return 0 <= row < len(grid) and 0 <= col < len(grid[0])
```
