## Question

>Given an unsorted array of integers `nums`, return _the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence._
>You must write an algorithm that runs in `O(n)` time.
>
>**Example 1:**
>	**Input:** nums = [100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2]
>	**Output:** 4
>	**Explanation:** The longest consecutive elements sequence is `[1, 2, 3, 4]`. Therefore its length is 4.

## Goal:
- Count the longest sequence

## Logic
1. use set - **remove duplicates** from a list
2. find the start `num`
3. `num+1` to find the length
## Code:
```python
class Solution:
    def longestConsecutive(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        num_set = set(nums)
        longest = 0

        for num in num_set:
            if num - 1 not in num_set:
                length = 1
                current = num

                while current + 1 in num_set:
                    current += 1
                    length += 1

                longest = max(longest, length)

        return longest
```
