## Question

For each empty room, fill it with the shortest distance -> BFS

## Method 1 - BFS

### Approach: BFS

1. Put all gates into queue first
2. Do BFS level by level
3. Repeat until the queue is empty

### Complexity

- TC: O(mn)
- SC: O(mn)

### Question

Q: why only check `grid[nr][nc] == float('inf')`?
BFS explores level by level. The first time reach a room, that path length is the shortest possible.

### Code

```python
class Solution:
    def wallsAndGates(self, rooms: List[List[int]]) -> None:
        rows, cols = len(rooms), len(rooms[0])
        queue = deque()
        dirs = ((1, 0), (-1, 0), (0, 1),(0, -1))
        visited = set()

        for r in range(rows):
            for c in range(cols):
                if rooms[r][c] == 0:
                    queue.append((r, c))

        while queue:
            r, c = queue.popleft()
            visited.add((r, c))
            for dr, dc in dirs:
                nr, nc = dr + r, dc + c

                if (
                    (not (0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols)) or
                    rooms[nr][nc] == -1 or
                    rooms[nr][nc] == 0 or
                    (nr, nc) in visited
                ):
                    continue

                if rooms[nr][nc] == 2147483647:
                    rooms[nr][nc] = rooms[r][c] + 1

                queue.append((nr, nc))
                visited.add((nr, nc))
```
