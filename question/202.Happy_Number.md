## Question
> Write an algorithm to determine if a number `n` is happy.
>
> A **happy number** is a number defined by the following process:
> - Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits.
> - Repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it **loops endlessly in a cycle** which does not include 1.
> - Those numbers for which this process **ends in 1** are happy.
>
> Return `true` _if_ `n` _is a happy number, and_ `false` _if not_.
> **Example 1:**
>
>> **Input:** n = 19
>> **Output:** true
>> **Explanation:**
>> - 12 + 92 = 82
>> - 82 + 22 = 68
>> - 62 + 82 = 100
>> - 12 + 02 + 02 = 1
## Goal
Determine whether a given positive integer `n` is a **happy number**.
- A number is **happy** if, by repeatedly replacing it with the **sum of the squares of its digits**, you eventually reach `1`.
- If the process **enters a cycle that does not include `1`**, the number is **not** happy.
## Logic
1. Define a helper function to compute the **sum of squares of digits** of a number.
2. Initialize two variables: `slow` and `fast`, both starting at `n`.
3.  In a loop:
    - Move `slow` by one step: `slow = get_next(slow)`
    - Move `fast` by two steps: `fast = get_next(get_next(fast))`
4. If `fast == 1`, return `True` (it’s a happy number).
5. If `slow == fast` (and not 1), we’ve entered a **cycle** → return `False`.
## Code
```python
class Solution:
    def isHappy(self, n: int) -> bool:
        slow = fast = n
        while True:
            slow = self.get_next_num(slow)
            fast = self.get_next_num(self.get_next_num(fast))
            if fast == 1:
                return True
            elif fast == slow:
                return False
    
    def get_next_num(self, x):
        next_num = 0
        while x > 0:
            digit = x % 10 # mod
            x //= 10       # floor division: Keep only the integer part
            next_num += digit ** 2
        return next_num
```

## Complexity analysis
- Time Complexity: O(log(n))
- Space Complexity: O(1)
