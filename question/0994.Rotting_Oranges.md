[Rotting Oranges - LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/rotting-oranges/description/) - medium
## Question
>You are given an `m x n` `grid` where each cell can have one of three values:
> - `0` representing an empty cell,
> - `1` representing a fresh orange, or
> - `2` representing a rotten orange.
>
> Every minute, any fresh orange that is **4-directionally adjacent** to a rotten orange becomes rotten.
> Return _the minimum number of minutes that must elapse until no cell has a fresh orange_. If _this is impossible, return_ `-1`.
> **Example 1:**<br>

>> **Input:**<br>
>> grid = `[[2,1,1],[1,1,0],[0,1,1]]`<br>
>> **Output:** 4<br>
## Goal:

## Logic
- **BFS**
1. Track state:
	- `fresh`: count the number of fresh oranges
	- `minutes`: to record how many steps it takes to rot all fresh oranges
2. Use BFS
	- level by level, 
	- use `queue` to record next orange affect
	BFS logic:
	1. loop `queue`
	2. for each rotten orange, infect 4 neighbor
	3. if fresh orange is infected, mark it as rotten
	4. after processing full level, increment minutes
3. Exit:
	- if fresh is 0, return minutes
	- if `queue` empty but `fresh > 0`, return `-1`

## Code:
```python
class Solution:
    def orangesRotting(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        if not grid:
            return -1
        dirs = [(1, 0), (-1, 0), (0, 1), (0, -1)]
        queue = deque()
        rows, cols = len(grid), len(grid[0])
        fresh = minutes = 0
        
        for row in range(rows):
            for col in range(cols):
                num = grid[row][col]
                if num == 1:
                    fresh += 1
                if num == 2:
                    queue.append((row, col))

        while queue and fresh > 0:
            for _ in range(len(queue)):
                row, col = queue.popleft()
                for d in dirs:
                    next_row, next_col = row + d[0], col + d[1]
                    if (self.is_within_bound(next_row, next_col, grid)
                        and grid[next_row][next_col] == 1):
                        grid[next_row][next_col] = 2
                        fresh -= 1
                        queue.append((next_row, next_col))
            minutes += 1

        return minutes if fresh == 0 else -1

    def is_within_bound(self, row, col, grid):
        return 0 <= row < len(grid) and 0 <= col < len(grid[0])
```
