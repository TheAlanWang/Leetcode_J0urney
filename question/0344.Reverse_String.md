## Solution
### Approach: Two Pointers (In-Place Swap)
We use two pointers, one starting from the left and one from the right. 
At each step, we swap the characters at these pointers and move them toward the center. 
This ensures the string is reversed in place without using extra memory.
### Complexity
- TC: O(n)
- SC: O(1)
### Code
```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def reverseString(self, s: List[str]) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify s in-place instead.
        """
        left, right = 0, len(s) - 1
        while left < right:
            s[left], s[right] = s[right], s[left]
            left += 1
            right -= 1
```
