## Question
>Given a binary tree, find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the tree.
>
> According to the [definition of LCA on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowest_common_ancestor): “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes `p` and `q` as the lowest node in `T` that has both `p` and `q` as descendants (where we allow **a node to be a descendant of itself**).”

>> **Input:** root = `[3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4]`, p = 5, q = 1 <br>
>> **Output:** 3 <br>
>> **Explanation:** The LCA of nodes 5 and 1 is 3. <br>
## Goal
- Find the **lowest common ancestor (LCA)** of two given nodes `p` and `q` in a **binary tree**. <br>
## Logic
1. If the current node is `None`, or equals `p` or `q`, return it.
2. Recursively search `p` and `q` in the left and right subtrees.
3. If both sides return non-null, current node is the LCA.
4. Otherwise, return the non-null result (either `p` or `q` is deeper in one side).
## Code
```python
class Solution:
    def lowestCommonAncestor(self, root: 'TreeNode', p: 'TreeNode', q: 'TreeNode') -> 'TreeNode':
        if not root or root == p or root == q:
            return root

        left = self.lowestCommonAncestor(root.left, p, q)
        right = self.lowestCommonAncestor(root.right, p, q)

        if left and right:
            return root

        return left if left else right
```
