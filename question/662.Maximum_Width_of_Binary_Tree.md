[Maximum Width of Binary Tree - LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-width-of-binary-tree/description/) - medium
## Question
> Given the `root` of a binary tree, return _the **maximum width** of the given tree_.
> 
> The **maximum width** of a tree is the maximum **width** among all levels.
> 
> The **width** of one level is defined as the length between the end-nodes (the leftmost and rightmost non-null nodes), where the null nodes between the end-nodes that would be present in a complete binary tree extending down to that level are also counted into the length calculation.
> 
> It is **guaranteed** that the answer will in the range of a **32-bit** signed integer.

> **Example 1:**
>> <img src="pic/pic_662.Maximum_Width_of_Binary_Tree.png" width="300"> <br>
>> **Input:** root = `[1,3,2,5,3,null,9]`<br>
>> **Output:** 4<br>
>> **Explanation:** The maximum width exists in the third level with length 4 `(5,3,null,9)`.
## Goal
- I want to find the **maximum width** of a binary tree. The width of a level is defined as the distance between the **leftmost** and **rightmost** non-null nodes at that level, including nulls in between.
## Logic
- Level by level to calculate the maximum width - by using BFS
- To solve this, I use BFS(level-order traversal), since I want to process the tree level by level.
- I use queue that store the tuples of `(node, index)` - where `index` represents the node's position as if the tree were a complete binary tree. This helps me calculate width even when nodes are missing in between.
- St each node, I compute the width as`most left - most right + 1`
## Code
```python
class Solution:
    def widthOfBinaryTree(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> int:
        if not root:
            return 0
        
        queue = deque([(root, 0)])
        max_width = 0

        while queue:
            level_length = len(queue)
            most_left, most_right = queue[0][1], queue[-1][1]
            width = most_right - most_left + 1
            max_width = max(max_width, width)

            for _ in range(level_length):
                node, index = queue.popleft()
                if node.left:
                    queue.append((node.left, index * 2))
                if node.right:
                    queue.append((node.right, index * 2 + 1))
        
        return max_width
```
