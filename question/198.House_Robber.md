[House Robber - LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/house-robber/) - medium
## Question
> You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed, the only constraint stopping you from robbing each of them is that adjacent houses have security systems connected and **it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night**.
> 
> Given an integer array `nums` representing the amount of money of each house, return _the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight **without alerting the police**_.
> 
> **Example 1:**
>> **Input:** `nums = [1,2,3,1]` <br>
>> **Output:** 4 <br>
>> **Explanation:** Rob house 1 (money = 1) and then rob house 3 (money = 3). <br>
>> Total amount you can rob = 1 + 3 = 4.
## Goal
 - Try to get the maximum number in nums, but the number can not be adjacent.
## Method 1 - Space Complexity O(n)
- Greedy approach overlook the long-term consequences.
### Logic
> [!note]
> dp[i] = max money that can be robbed up to house i
> - Option 1: skip house i → `dp[i - 1]`
> - Option 2: rob house i → `nums[i] + dp[i - 2]`
### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def rob(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        if not nums:
            return 0
        
        if len(nums) == 1:
            return nums[0]
        
        dp = [0] * len(nums)
		# dp[i] = max money that can be robbed up to house i
		# Option 1: skip house i → dp[i - 1]
		# Option 2: rob house i → nums[i] + dp[i - 2]
        dp[0] = nums[0]
        dp[1] = max(dp[0], nums[1])
        for i in range(2, len(nums)):
            dp[i] = max(dp[i - 1], nums[i] + dp[i - 2])
        
        return dp[len(nums) - 1]
```
### Complexity analysis
- Time Complexity: O(n)
- Space Complexity: O(n)
## Method 2 - Space Complexity O(1)
use two variable to keep track of the previous two value:
- `pre_profit`: max profit up to house `i - 1`
- `pre_pre_profit`: max profit up to house `i - 2`
```python
class Solution:
    def rob(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        if not nums:
            return 0
        
        if len(nums) == 1:
            return nums[0]
        
        # skip: total_p[i] = t_p[i-1]
        # rob: total_p[i] = p[i] + t_p[i-2]
        pre_pre_profit = nums[0] # 0
        pre_profit = max(nums[1], pre_pre_profit) # 1

        for i in range(2, len(nums)):
            curr_profit = max(pre_pre_profit + nums[i], pre_profit)
            pre_pre_profit = pre_profit
            pre_profit = curr_profit
        
        return pre_profit
```
