## Question
> Given an array of meeting time interval objects consisting of start and end timesÂ `[[start_1,end_1],[start_2,end_2],...] (start_i < end_i)`, find the minimum number of days required to schedule all meetings without any conflicts.
> 
> **Example 1:**
>> Input: intervals = `[(0,40),(5,10),(15,20)]` <br>
>> Output: 2 <br>
>> Explanation: <br>
>> 	`day1: (0,40)`<br>
>> 	`day2: (5,10),(15,20)`<br>
## Method 1: Sweep Line Algorithm
> [!note]
> Sweep line algorithm for solving interval and gemoetry problems, especially when we care about events over time.
> In this question, break all intervals into points: start and end times, then simulate a timeline by sweeping from left to right, tracking the number of active meeting.

### Logic
- use `sweeping line algorithm` to process interval start and end events.
1. Convert each interval into two events
2. Sort the event list
3. Sweep through events:
   - Keep a counter of active intervals.
   - Update `max_overlap` as the maximum value of this counter.
1. Return the max_overlap
### Code
```python
"""
Definition of Interval:
class Interval(object):
    def __init__(self, start, end):
        self.start = start
        self.end = end
"""
class Solution:
    def minMeetingRooms(self, intervals: List[Interval]) -> int:
        points = []
        for interval in intervals:
            points.append((interval.start, 'start'))
            points.append((interval.end, 'end'))
        
        points.sort(key=lambda x: (x[0], 1 if x[1] == 'start' else 0)) # end then start
        
        active_intervals = 0
        max_overlap = 0
        for time, point_type in points:
            if point_type == 'start':
                active_intervals += 1
            else:
                active_intervals -= 1
            max_overlap = max(max_overlap, active_intervals)
        
        return max_overlap      
```
### Complexity analysis
- Time Complexity: O(nlogn)
	- sort is O(nlogn)
- Space Complexity: O(n)
## Method 2: Heap
> [!note] 
> Use a **min-heap** to always keep track of the **earliest ending meeting**. If a new meeting starts **after or when** the earliest meeting ends, we can **reuse** that room.
### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def minMeetingRooms(self, intervals: List[Interval]) -> int:
        if not intervals:
            return 0
        intervals.sort(key=lambda x: x.start)
        heap = [intervals[0].end]

        for interval in intervals[1:]:
            if interval.start >= heap[0]:
                heapq.heappop(heap)
            
            heapq.heappush(heap, interval.end)
        
        return len(heap)
```
### Complexity analysis
- Time Complexity: O(nlogn)
	- `heappop()` and `heappush()` is O(logk)
- Space Complexity: O(n)
## Pre-knowledge
- intervals
	- sweeping line algorithm
- heap
