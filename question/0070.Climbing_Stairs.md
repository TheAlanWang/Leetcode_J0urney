[Climbing Stairs - LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/climbing-stairs/description/) - easy
## Question
> You are climbing a staircase. It takes `n` steps to reach the top.
> Each time you can either climb `1` or `2` steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?
>
> **Example 1:**
>> **Input:** n = 2
>> **Output:** 2
>> **Explanation:** There are two ways to climb to the top.
>> 	1. 1 step + 1 step
>> 	2. 2 steps
## Goal
- Count the number of  distinct ways to reach the top by climbing either 1 or 2 steps at a time
## Logic
>[!note]
> Method 1: Top to bottom -> Recursion (may cause stack overflow) <br>
> Method 2: Top to bottom -> Recursion (optimize repeated calls) <br>
> Method 3: Bottom to top -> Dynamic Programming (avoid recursion stack overflow) <br>
> Method 4: Bottom to top -> Dynamic Programming (only store last two steps) <br>
## Code
### Method1 Recursion - Cause Time Limit Exceeded
```python
class Solution:
    def climbStairs(self, n: int) -> int:

        def dfs(n):
            if n <= 2:
                return n
                
            return dfs(n - 1) + dfs(n - 2)
        
        return dfs(n)
```
#### Complexity analysis
- Time Complexity: O($2^n$)
- Space Complexity: O(n)
### Method2 Recursion - With memo
```python
class Solution:
    def climbStairs(self, n: int) -> int:
        memo = {}
        def dfs(n):
            if n <= 2:
                return n
            
            if n in memo:
                return memo[n] # Time complexity: O(n); Space complexity: O(n)
            
            memo[n] = dfs(n-1) + dfs(n-2)
            
            return memo[n]
            
        return dfs(n)
```
#### Complexity analysis
- Time Complexity: O(n)
- Space Complexity: O(n)
### Method3 Dynamic Programming
```python
class Solution:
    def climbStairs(self, n: int) -> int:
        if n <= 2:
            return n
        dp = [0] * (n + 1)
        dp[1], dp[2] = 1, 2

        for i in range(3, n + 1):
            dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2]
        
        return dp[n]
```
#### Complexity analysis
- Time Complexity: O(n)
- Space Complexity: O(n)
### Method4 Dynamic Programming
```python
class Solution:
    def climbStairs(self, n: int) -> int:
        if n <= 2:
            return n
        
        one_steps_before, two_steps_before = 2, 1

        for i in range(3, n + 1):

            curr = one_steps_before + two_steps_before
            two_steps_before = one_steps_before
            one_steps_before = curr
        
        return one_steps_before
```
> Explain:
> - `one_steps_before, two_steps_before = 2, 1`
> - To reach step 3 = way to s2 + way to s1
>    - there are two ways to step 2 : `1 + 1` and `2` -> one_steps_before is 2
>    - there are one way to step 1: `1` -> two_steps_before is 1
#### Complexity analysis
- Time Complexity: O(n)
- Space Complexity: O(1)
