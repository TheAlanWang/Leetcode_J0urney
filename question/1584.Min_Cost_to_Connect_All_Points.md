[1584. Min Cost to Connect All Points](https://leetcode.com/problems/min-cost-to-connect-all-points/)

## Question
> Example:
>> **Input:** points = `[[0,0],[2,2],[3,10],[5,2],[7,0]]`
>> **Output:** 20

## Method 1 - Prim's Algorithm
- Minimum Spanning Tree
### Approach
Initialize the graph
1. store (x, y) into dict
2. update dict `{0:[[[4, 1], [13, 2], [7, 3], [7, 4]]], 1:[...], 2: [...]}` -> `{node:[cost, node]}`
#### Complexity:
- Time Complexity: $O(n^{2}LogN)$
- Space Complexity: $O(n^2)$
### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def minCostConnectPoints(self, points: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        n = len(points)
        
        adj = {i:[] for i in range(n)} # {0:[], 1:[],}
        for i in range(n):
            x1, y1 = points[i]
            for j in range(i + 1, n):
                x2, y2 = points[j]
                dist = abs(x1 - x2) + abs(y1 - y2)
                adj[i].append([dist, j])
                adj[j].append([dist, i])
        
        res = 0
        visited = set()
        minheap = [[0, 0]] # [cost, point]
        while len(visited) < n:
            cost, i = heapq.heappop(minheap)
            if i in visited:
                continue
            res += cost
            visited.add(i)
            for neiCost, nei in adj[i]:
                if nei not in visited:
                    heapq.heappush(minheap, [neiCost, nei])
        return res
