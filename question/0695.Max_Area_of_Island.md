[Max Area of Island - LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/max-area-of-island/description/) - medium
## Question
>You are given an `m x n` binary matrix `grid`. An island is a group of `1`'s (representing land) connected **4-directionally** (horizontal or vertical.) You may assume all four edges of the grid are surrounded by water.
>The **area** of an island is the number of cells with a value `1` in the island.
>Return _the maximum **area** of an island in_ `grid`. If there is no island, return `0`.

>>      `[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],`<br>
>>      `[0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],`<br>
>>      `[0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0],`<br>
>>      `[0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0],`<br>
>>      `[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0],`<br>
>>      `[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],`<br>
>>      `[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0]]`<br>
>>**Output:** 6<br>
>>**Explanation:** The answer is not 11, because the island must be connected 4-directionally.
## Goal
- We are given a 2D grid of 0s and 1s, where `1` represents land and `0` represents water. An _island_ is a group of connected `1`s (horizontally or vertically, not diagonally). The goal is to find the **maximum area** (number of 1s) of any island in the grid.
## Logic
1. I treat the grid as a graph where each cell is a node. I traverse the entire grid cell by cell. Whenever I find a land cell (`1`) that hasn't been visited, I perform a **BFS** (Breadth-First Search) to explore the entire island starting from that cell.
2. During BFS, I keep track of visited cells to avoid counting the same island multiple times. For each BFS run, I count how many land cells are connected — this gives me the size of one island. I compare it with the current maximum area and update it if needed.
3. After checking all cells, the largest area recorded is the size of the biggest island in the grid.

## Code
```python
class Solution:
    def maxAreaOfIsland(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        rows, cols = len(grid), len(grid[0])
        visited = [[0] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
        max_size = 0

        for row in range(rows):
            for col in range(cols):
                if grid[row][col] == 1 and visited[row][col] == 0:
                    size = self.bfs(row, col, grid, visited)
                    max_size = max(max_size, size)
        return max_size
    
    def bfs(self, row: int, col: int, grid: list[list[int]], visited: list[list[int]]) -> int:
        dirs = ((1, 0), (-1, 0), (0, 1), (0, -1))
        queue = deque([(row, col)])
        visited[row][col] = 1
        
        size = 0
        while queue:
            land_row, land_col = queue.popleft()
            size += 1
            for d in dirs:
                next_row = land_row + d[0]
                next_col = land_col + d[1]
                if (self.within_bound(next_row, next_col, grid)
                    and visited[next_row][next_col] == 0
                    and grid[next_row][next_col] == 1):
                    queue.append((next_row, next_col))
                    visited[next_row][next_col] = 1
        return size

    def within_bound(self, row: int, col: int, grid) -> bool:
        return 0 <= row < len(grid) and 0 <= col < len(grid[0])
```
