[Longest Repeating Character Replacement - LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-repeating-character-replacement/description/) - medium
## Question
> You are given a string `s` and an integer `k`. You can choose any character of the string and change it to any other uppercase English character. You can perform this operation at most `k` times.
> Return _the length of the longest substring containing the same letter you can get after performing the above operations_.
> 
> **Example 1:**
>> **Input:** s = "ABAB", k = 2 <br>
>> **Output:** 4 <br>
>> **Explanation:** Replace the two 'A's with two 'B's or vice versa. <br>
## Goal
- Find the length of the longest substring that can be turned into a string of all the same character by replacing **at most `k` characters**.
## Logic
> [!note]
> - Use **dynamic sliding window** to find the longest valid substring + **Dictionary** to store the character frequencies
> - Shrink window when `(window length - max frequency) > k`
1. Use a dictionary to count the frequency of characters in the current window
2. Track the count of the most frequent character in the window (let’s call it `max_freq`)
3. If the number of characters to replace (`window_size - max_freq`) is **greater than `k`**, it means:
	- Too many replacements are needed, so **shrink the window** from the left.
4. Otherwise:
    - The window is valid, so expand to the right and **update the max length**.
## Code
```python
class Solution:
    def characterReplacement(self, s: str, k: int) -> int:
        freqs = {}
        highest_freq = max_len = 0
        left = right = 0
        while right < len(s):
            freqs[s[right]] = freqs.get(s[right], 0) + 1
            highest_freq = max(highest_freq, freqs[s[right]])
            num_chars_to_replace = (right - left + 1) - highest_freq

            if num_chars_to_replace > k:
                freqs[s[left]] -= 1
                left += 1
            
            max_len = right - left + 1
            right += 1
        
        return max_len
```
