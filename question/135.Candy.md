[Candy - LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/candy/description/) - hard
## Question
> There are `n` children standing in a line. Each child is assigned a rating value given in the integer array `ratings`.
> You are giving candies to these children subjected to the following requirements:
> 	- Each child must have at least one candy.
> 	- Children with a higher rating get more candies than their neighbors.
> Return _the minimum number of candies you need to have to distribute the candies to the children_.
> 
> **Example 1:**
>> **Input:** ratings = `[1,0,2]`
>> **Output:** 5
>> **Explanation:** You can allocate to the first, second and third child with 2, 1, 2 candies respectively.
## Goal
- Count the minimum number of candies to distribute to children, satisfying both neighbor constraints.
## Logic
> [!note]
> Greedy Algorithm: make the local optimal choice
> - Use two greedy passes (left-to-right, right-to-left)
> - use `max()` to preserve the correct candy count

## Code
```python
class Solution:
    def candy(self, ratings: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(ratings)
        candies = [1] * n
        for i in range(1, n):
            if ratings[i] > ratings[i - 1]:
                candies[i] = candies[i - 1] + 1

        for i in range(n - 2, -1, -1):
            if ratings[i] > ratings[i + 1]:
                candies[i] = max(candies[i], candies[i + 1] + 1)

        return sum(candies)
```
