## Question
> There is a robot on an `m x n` grid. The robot is initially located at the **top-left corner** (i.e., `grid[0][0]`). The robot tries to move to the **bottom-right corner** (i.e., `grid[m - 1][n - 1]`). The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time.
> Given the two integers `m` and `n`, return _the number of possible unique paths that the robot can take to reach the bottom-right corner_.
> 
> The test cases are generated so that the answer will be less than or equal to `2 * 109`.

## Goal
- Find the number of all possible unique paths from top-left corner to bottom-right corner in an `m * n` grid
## Logic
> [!note]
> - `dp[r][c] = dp[r - 1][c] + dp[r][c - 1]`
## Code
```python
class Solution:
    def uniquePaths(self, m: int, n: int) -> int:
        dp = [[1] * n for _ in range(m)]
        
        for r in range(1, m):
            for c in range(1, n):
                dp[r][c] = dp[r - 1][c] + dp[r][c - 1]
                
        return dp[m - 1][n - 1]
```

## Complexity analysis
- Time Complexity: O(`m * n`)
- Space Complexity: O(`m * n`)

## Reduce the Space Complexity to O(n):
```python
class Solution:
    def uniquePaths(self, m: int, n: int) -> int:
        prev_row = [1] * n
        
        for r in range(1, m):
            curr_row = [1] * n
            for c in range(1, n):
                curr_row[c] = prev_row[c] + curr_row[c - 1]
            
            prev_row = curr_row
        
        return prev_row[n - 1]
```
