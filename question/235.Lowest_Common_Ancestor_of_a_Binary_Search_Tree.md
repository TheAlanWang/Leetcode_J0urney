[235. Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Search Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/lowest-common-ancestor-of-a-binary-search-tree/) - medium
## Question
> Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) node of two given nodes in the BST.
>
> According to the [definition of LCA on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowest_common_ancestor): “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes `p` and `q` as the lowest node in `T` that has both `p` and `q` as descendants (where we allow **a node to be a descendant of itself**).”
> Example 1:
> <img src="pic/pic_235.Lowest_Common_Ancestor_of_a_Binary_Search_Tree.png" width="300"><br>
>> **Input:** root = `[6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5]`, p = 2, q = 8 <br>
>> **Output:** 6<br>
>> **Explanation:** The LCA of nodes `2` and `8` is `6`.

## Goal
- Find the Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA) of tow node `p` and `q` in a Binary Search Tree.
## Logic
- Because this is a Binary Search Tree. I don't need to traversal the whole tree. Using iterative DFS
- I can compare the values of `p` and `q` to the current node.
	- if they're both smaller, move left
	- if they're both larger, move right
	- the moment they diverge, the current node is the LCA.
## Code
```python
class Solution:
    def lowestCommonAncestor(self, root: 'TreeNode', p: 'TreeNode', q: 'TreeNode') -> 'TreeNode':
        while root:
            if p.val < root.val and q.val < root.val:
                root = root.left
            elif p.val > root.val and q.val > root.val:
                root = root.right
            else:
                return root
        return None
```

- Time Complexity: O(h)
	- h is the height of tree
- Space Complexity: O(1)
