'''
Clarifications: 
    - we need the minimum speed k so Koko finished within h hours

Approach: binary search (find minimum speed) `times(k) <= h`
Key insight:
    - As spd increase, time decrease
Transitions:
    def the function: eat_time = (pile + spd - 1) // spd
    use lower bound, find the first k where a monotone predicate becomes True
    
* TC: O(nlogn) | SC: O(1)
