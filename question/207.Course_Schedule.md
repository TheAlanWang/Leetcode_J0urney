## Question
>There are a total of `numCourses` courses you have to take, labeled from `0` to `numCourses - 1`. You are given an array `prerequisites` where `prerequisites[i] = [ai, bi]` indicates that you **must** take course `bi` first if you want to take course `ai`.
> For example, the pair `[0, 1]`, indicates that to take course `0` you have to first take course `1`.
> Return `true` if you can finish all courses. Otherwise, return `false`.
> 
>**Example 1:**
>>**Input:** numCourses = 2, prerequisites = `[[1,0]]`
>>**Output:** true
>>**Explanation:** There are a total of 2 courses to take. To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So it is possible.
>
>**Example 2:**
>>**Input:** numCourses = 2, prerequisites = `[[1,0],[0,1]]`
>>**Output:** false
>>**Explanation:** There are a total of 2 courses to take. To take course 1 you should have finished course 0, and to take course 0 you should also have finished course 1. So it is impossible.

## Goal:
- Determine whether it's possible to finish all courses given their prerequisites.

## Logic
1. Initial `graph` and `in_degrees`
	- `graph = defaultdict(list)`
	- `in_degrees = [0] * len(n)`
2. Build the graph and in_degree list:
	- graph`[prereq].append()`
	- update in_degrees
3. Initial BFS queue:
	- put in_degrees is 0 in queue, prepare queue for bfs
4. bfs:
	1. `popleft
	2. `in_degree -= 1`
5. final check
## Code:
```python
class Solution:
    def canFinish(self, numCourses: int, prerequisites: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
        graph = defaultdict(list)
        in_degrees = [0] * numCourses

        for course, prereq in prerequisites:
            graph[prereq].append(course)
            in_degrees[course] += 1
        
        queue = deque()
        enroll_course = 0
        for i in range(numCourses):
            if in_degrees[i] == 0:
                queue.append(i)
        
        while queue:
            course = queue.popleft()
            enroll_course += 1
            for neighbor in graph[course]:
                in_degrees[neighbor] -= 1
                if in_degrees[neighbor] == 0:
                    queue.append(neighbor)
        return enroll_course == numCourses
```
