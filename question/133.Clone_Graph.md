## Question
> Given a reference of a node in a **[connected](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connectivity_\(graph_theory\)#Connected_graph)** undirected graph.<br>
> Return a [**deep copy**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_copying#Deep_copy) (clone) of the graph.
> Each node in the graph contains a value (`int`) and a list (`List[Node]`) of its neighbors. <br>
>> class Node: <br>
>> 	def __init__(self, val = 0, neighbors = None): <br>
>> 	self.val = val <br>
>> 	self.neighbors = neighbors if neighbors is not None else [] <br>
>
> **Test case format:**<br>
> 	For simplicity, each node's value is the same as the node's index (1-indexed). For example, the first node with `val == 1`, the second node with `val == 2`, and so on. The graph is represented in the test case using an adjacency list.<br>
> 	**An adjacency list** is a collection of unordered **lists** used to represent a finite graph. Each list describes the set of neighbors of a node in the graph.<br>
> 	The given node will always be the first node with `val = 1`. You must return the **copy of the given node** as a reference to the cloned graph.<br>

>>  **Input:** adjList = `[[2,4],[1,3],[2,4],[1,3]]`<br>
>>  **Output:** `[[2,4],[1,3],[2,4],[1,3]]`<br>
>> **Explanation:** There are 4 nodes in the graph.<br>
>> 	  - 1st node (val = 1)'s neighbors are 2nd node (val = 2) and 4th node (val = 4).<br>
>> 	  - 2nd node (val = 2)'s neighbors are 1st node (val = 1) and 3rd node (val = 3).<br>
>> 	  - 3rd node (val = 3)'s neighbors are 2nd node (val = 2) and 4th node (val = 4).<br>
>> 	  - 4th node (val = 4)'s neighbors are 1st node (val = 1) and 3rd node (val = 3).<br>
## Goal
- Given a **reference to a node** in a connected **undirected graph**, return a **deep copy** (clone) of the entire graph.
## Logic
1. Visit each node **once**
2. For each node:
	- If a neighbor hasn't been cloned yet:
		- Clone it, and enqueue it
	- Always append the cloned neighbor to the current node’s cloned `neighbors` list
3. Return the clone of the **starting node**

Hint:
- use *dictionary* store visited node {original node: cloned node}
## Code
### Method 1 BFS
```python
class Solution:
    def cloneGraph(self, node: Optional['Node']) -> Optional['Node']:
        if not node:
            return None

        cloned = {}
        queue = deque([node])
        cloned[node] = Node(node.val)

        while queue:
            curr = queue.popleft()
            for nei in curr.neighbors:
                if nei not in cloned:
                    cloned[nei] = Node(nei.val)
                    queue.append(nei)
                cloned[curr].neighbors.append(cloned[nei])

        return cloned[node]
```
### Method 2 DFS
```python
from typing import Optional
class Solution:
    def cloneGraph(self, node: Optional['Node']) -> Optional['Node']:
        if not node:
            return None
        return self.dfs(node)
    
    def dfs(self, node, clone_map={}):
        if node in clone_map:
            return clone_map[node]
        
        cloned_node = Node(node.val)
        clone_map[node] = cloned_node

        for nei in node.neighbors:
            cloned_nei = self.dfs(nei, clone_map)
            cloned_node.neighbors.append(cloned_nei)
        return cloned_node
```
