## Question
## Method 1: Traversal
### Approach
- count the total number of laser beam
- beam exists between non-empty row
#### Complexity
- Time Complexity: O($m*n$)
- Space Complexity: O(n)
### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def numberOfBeams(self, bank: List[str]) -> int:
        res = 0
        prev = 0
        for row in bank:
            count = 0
            for c in row:
                if c == "1":
                    count += 1
            
            if count > 0:
                res += prev * count
                prev = count

        return res
```
