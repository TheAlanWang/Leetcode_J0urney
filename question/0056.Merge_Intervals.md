## Question
> Given an array of `intervals` where `intervals[i] = [starti, endi]`, merge all overlapping intervals, and return _an array of the non-overlapping intervals that cover all the intervals in the input_.
> 
> **Example 1:**
>> **Input:** intervals = `[[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]`
>> **Output:** `[[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]`
>> **Explanation:** Since intervals `[1,3]` and `[2,6]` overlap, merge them into `[1,6]`.
## Goal
- We're given a list of intervals, each represented as `[start, end]`. Our goal is to merge any overlapping intervals and return a list of non-overlapping intervals sorted by start time.
## Logic
1. sort the intervals
2. Two intervals A and B, 
	- If they overlap → **merge** them
	- If they do NOT overlap → append B to the result
## Code
```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def merge(self, intervals: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
        intervals = sorted(intervals, key=lambda x:x[0])

        res = []
        
        for start, end in intervals:
            if res and  start <= res[-1][1]:
                res[-1][1] = max(res[-1][1], end)
            else:
                res.append([start, end]) 
        
        return res
```
