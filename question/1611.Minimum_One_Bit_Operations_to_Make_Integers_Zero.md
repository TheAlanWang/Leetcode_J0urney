## Question
## Method
---


- `1000 -> 0000` will take $2^{k+1}-1$, k is 3, which is $2^4-1=15$
- `(2**k) ^ n` get ride of the highest number `^ is XOR`

```
1010 ^ 1000 = 010 -> 2
f(10) = 2^(3+1) - 1 - f(2) = 15 - f(2)
f(2)= 2^(1+1) - 1 - f(2 ^ 2) = 4 - 1 - f(0) = 3
f(10) = 15 - 3 = 12
```
#### Complexity
- Time Complexity: $O(logn)$
	- recursion call
- Space Complexity: $O(logn)$
### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def minimumOneBitOperations(self, n: int) -> int:
        if n == 0:
            return 0
        
        k = 0
        while 2 ** k <= n:
            k += 1
        
        k -= 1
        return 2 ** (k + 1) - 1 - self.minimumOneBitOperations((2**k) ^ n)

```
