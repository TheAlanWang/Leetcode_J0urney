## Question

>Given an array `nums` with `n` objects colored red, white, or blue, sort them in-place so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white, and blue.
>
>We will use the integers `0`, `1`, and `2` to represent the color red, white, and blue, respectively.
>You must solve this problem without using the library's sort function.
>
>Example 1:
>	Input: nums = [2,0,2,1,1,0]
>	Output: [0,0,1,1,2,2]
>
>Example 2:
>	Input: nums = [2,0,1]
>	Output: [0,1,2]

## Logic

### Goal:
Sort an array containing only 0s, 1s, and 2s **in-place** so that all 0s come first, followed by 1s, and then 2s.
### Three Pointers:
We use three pointers to divide the array into 4 regions:
- `left`: the next position to place a `0`.
- `right`: the next position to place a `2`.
- `i`: the current index being processed.

We move through the array **from left to right** with `i`, and for each number:
## Code:
```python
class Solution:
    def sortColors(self, nums: List[int]) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify nums in-place instead.
        """
        left, i, right = 0, 0, len(nums) - 1
        
        while i <= right:
            if nums[i] == 0:
                nums[i], nums[left] = nums[left], nums[i]
                i += 1
                left += 1
            elif nums[i] == 2:
                nums[i], nums[right] = nums[right], nums[i]
                right -= 1
            else:  # nums[i] == 1
                i += 1
```

## Complexity analysis
Time Complexity: O(n)，Space Complexity: O(1)

## Sample: 
Start [2, 1, 0, 1, 2]
1. [2, 1, 0, 1, 2]  l = 0, i = 0, r = 4
2. [1, 1, 0, 2, 2]  l = 0, i = 0, r = 3
3. [1, 1, 0, 2, 2]  l = 0, i = 1, r = 3
4. [1, 1, 0, 2, 2]  l = 0, i = 2, r = 3
5. [0, 1, 1, 2, 2]  l = 1, i = 3, r = 3
