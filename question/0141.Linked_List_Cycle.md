[Linked List Cycle - LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle/description/) - easy
## Question
> Given `head`, the head of a linked list, determine if the linked list has a cycle in it.
> There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the `next` pointer. Internally, `pos` is used to denote the index of the node that tail's `next` pointer is connected to. **Note that `pos` is not passed as a parameter**.
> Return `true` _if there is a cycle in the linked list_. Otherwise, return `false`.
> 
> Example1:
>> **Input:** head = `[3,2,0,-4]`, pos = 1
>> **Output:** true 
>> **Explanation:** There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 1st node (0-indexed).
## Goal:
- Determine whether the cycle in a linked list
## Method 1 - Floyd’s Cycle Detection (Tortoise and Hare)
### Approach
1. Initialize two pointers - slow pointer and faster pointer
	- the slow pointer move one step at a time
	- the fast pointer move two step at a time
2. If the fast pointer ever meets the slow pointer, a cycle exists
3. If the fast pointer reaches the end (None), there is no cycle
#### Complexity:
- Time Complexity: O(n)
- Space: O(1)
### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def hasCycle(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> bool:
        slow = fast = head

        while fast and fast.next:
            slow = slow.next
            fast = fast.next.next

            if slow == fast:
                return True
        
        return False
```
#### Q&A
- Why do we use `while fast and fast.next` as the loop condition in the cycle detection algorithm?
> To safely access `fast.next.next`
> If we don't do, it will cause Attribute Error

- Why use `if slow == fast:` in cycle detection?
> Make sure two pointers point to the same node in memory, not just nodes with the same value
### Method 2: Space - O(n)
```python
class Solution:
    def hasCycle(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> bool:
        visited = set()
        cur = head
        while cur:
            if cur in visited:
                return True
            visited.add(cur)
            cur = cur.next
        return False
```

## Complexity analysis
### Method 1
- Time Complexity: O(n)
- Space Complexity: O(1)
### Method 2
- Time Complexity: O(n)
- Space Complexity: O(n)
