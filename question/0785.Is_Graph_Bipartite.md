[785. Is Graph Bipartite?](https://leetcode.com/problems/is-graph-bipartite/description/) - medium
## Question

>There is an **undirected** graph with `n` nodes, where each node is numbered between `0` and `n - 1`. You are given a 2D array `graph`, where `graph[u]` is an array of nodes that node `u` is adjacent to. More formally, for each `v` in `graph[u]`, there is an undirected edge between node `u` and node `v`. The graph has the following properties:
> - There are no self-edges (`graph[u]` does not contain `u`).
> - There are no parallel edges (`graph[u]` does not contain duplicate values).
> - If `v` is in `graph[u]`, then `u` is in `graph[v]` (the graph is undirected).
> - The graph may not be connected, meaning there may be two nodes `u` and `v` such that there is no path between them.
> - A graph is **bipartite** if the nodes can be partitioned into two independent sets `A` and `B` such that **every** edge in the graph connects a node in set `A` and a node in set `B`.
> - Return `true` _if and only if it is **bipartite**_.

>>	**Input:** graph = `[[1,2,3],[0,2],[0,1,3],[0,2]]`<br>
>>	**Output:** false<br>
>>	**Explanation:** There is no way to partition the nodes into two independent sets such that every edge connects a node in one and a node in the other.
## Goal:

## Logic
1. Create a list`colors` of size `n` to store node color
2. loop through each node in the graph.For any unvisited node`(colors[i] == 0 )`, start DFS from that node and try to color: `1` and `-1`. if node == 0, which means not visited, use `dfs` function to give the color
3. In the `dfs` function, 
	1. Assign current `node` the given `color`
	2. traverse all neighbors
	- neighbor had same color as current node, return False
	- if neighbor is unvisited node, neighbor color to `colors`, if conflict, return True
4. If all nodes are visited without conflict, return True<br>

Hint:
- Assign the opposite color to neighbors. 
- **Immediately** enqueue any unvisited (uncolored) neighbors after coloring.

## Code:
### Method 1: DFS 
```python
class Solution:
    def isBipartite(self, graph: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
        colors = [0] * len(graph)

        for i in range(len(graph)):
            if (colors[i] == 0
		and not self.dfs(i, 1, graph, colors)):	# if dfs is not true, return False
                return False
        return True
    
    def dfs(self, node, color, graph, colors):
        colors[node] = color
        for neighbor in graph[node]:
            if colors[neighbor] == color:
                return False
            if (colors[neighbor] == 0
		and not self.dfs(neighbor, -color, graph, colors)): # if neighbor not visited, find neighbor color
                return False
        return True 	# if no conflict found return True
```
### Method 2: BFS
```python
class Solution:
    def isBipartite(self, graph: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
        colors = [0] * len(graph) # 0 = unvisited

        for i in range(len(graph)): # disconnected components
            if colors[i] != 0:
                continue
            colors[i] = 1
            
            queue = deque([i]) # BSF: from i
            while queue:
                node = queue.popleft() 
                for neighbor in graph[node]:
                    if colors[neighbor] == colors[node]: # compare color to node
                        return False
                    elif colors[neighbor] == 0:
                        colors[neighbor] = -colors[node]
                        queue.append(neighbor)  # immediately add
        return True # when loop all the graph, return
```
## Complexity analysis
Time Complexity:  `O(n+e)` 
- n = node, loop every node once -> O(n)
- e = edge, loop neighbors (in undirected graphs, technically twice, but still O(e))
Space Complexity: `O(n)`
