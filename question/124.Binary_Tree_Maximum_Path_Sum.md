[Binary Tree Maximum Path Sum - LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-maximum-path-sum/) - hard
## Question
> A **path** in a binary tree is a sequence of nodes where each pair of adjacent nodes in the sequence has an edge connecting them. A node can only appear in the sequence **at most once**. Note that the path does not need to pass through the root.
> 
> The **path sum** of a path is the sum of the node's values in the path.
> Given the `root` of a binary tree, return _the maximum **path sum** of any **non-empty** path_.
> 
> Example 1:

>> **Input:** root = `[-10,9,20,null,null,15,7]`<br>
>> **Output:** 42<br>
>> **Explanation:** The optimal path is 15 -> 20 -> 7 with a path sum of 15 + 20 + 7 = 42.
## Goal
- Find the maximum path  in a binary tree
- A valid path:
	- must be a sequence of parent-child connected nodes
	- at least one node
	- do not need to pass through the root, (don't need to reach the leaf)
	- can go down to both left and right only when the current node is the highest point of the path
## Logic
- Recursion(DFS) to traversal the tree from bottom-up
1. Recursively calculate the max left_value
2. Recursively calculate the max right_value
3. Compute the maximum value is `node + left + right`
4. Return the one-side maximum path to parent

## Code
```python
class Solution:
    def maxPathSum(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> int:
        max_total = [float('-inf')]
        
        def helper(node) -> int:
            if not node:
                return 0

            left_gain = max(helper(node.left), 0)
            right_gain = max(helper(node.right), 0)
            path = node.val + left_gain + right_gain 
            max_total[0] = max(path, max_total[0])

            return node.val + max(left_gain, right_gain) # return one-side maximum path
        
        helper(root)
        return max_total[0]
```

## Sample
```md
        -10
       /   \
      9     20
     /     /  \
    5     15   7
```
### Step by step
```md
node = -10
  └─> node = 9
       └─> node = 5
             └─> left_gain = 0, right_gain = 0
             └─> path = 5, max_total = 5, return 5
       └─> back to node = 9, left_gain = 5, right_gain = 0
       └─> path = 14, max_total = 14, return 14

  └─> node = 20
       └─> node = 15
             └─> left_gain = 0, right_gain = 0
             └─> path = 15, max_total = 15, return 15
       └─> node = 7
             └─> left_gain = 0, right_gain = 0
             └─> path = 7, max_total = 15, return 7
       └─> back to node = 20, left_gain = 15, right_gain = 7
       └─> path = 42, max_total = 42, return 35

└─> back to node = -10, left_gain = 14, right_gain = 35
└─> path = 39, max_total = 42, return 25 (-10 + max(14, 35))
