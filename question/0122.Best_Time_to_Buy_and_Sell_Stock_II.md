[Best_Time_to_Buy_and_Sell_Stock_II](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-ii/description/)
## Question
- We can buy and sell as many times as we like

> Example:
>> **Input:** prices = `[7,1,5,3,6,4]`
>> **Output:** 7
>> **Explanation:** Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 3 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
>> Then buy on day 4 (price = 3) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-3 = 3.
>> Total profit is 4 + 3 = 7. 

## Method 1: Greedy (Optimal)
### Approach
- Take all the profits from every uphill movement.
#### Complexity
- Time Complexity: O(n)
- Space Complexity: O(1)
### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        max_profit = 0
        n = len(prices)
        for i in range(1, n):
            if prices[i] > prices[i - 1]: # sell > buy
                max_profit += prices[i] 
                max_profit -= prices[i - 1]
        
        return max_profit
```

## Method 2: Backtracking (Time Limited Exceed)
### Approach
- Determine buy and sell time
#### Complexity
- Time Complexity: O($2^n$)
- Space Complexity: O(n)
### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(prices)

        def dfs(start):
            if start >= n:
                return 0
            
            max_profit = 0
            for buy in range(start, n - 1):
                profit_for_this_start = 0
                for sell in range(buy + 1, n):
                    if prices[sell] > prices[buy]:
                        profit = (
                            dfs(sell + 1)
                            + prices[sell]
                            - prices[buy]
                        )
                        if profit > profit_for_this_start:
                            profit_for_this_start = profit
                
                if profit_for_this_start > max_profit:
                    max_profit = profit_for_this_start
                
            return max_profit
        
        return dfs(0)
```
