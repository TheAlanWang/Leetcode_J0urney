# 
# Method 1: dp TC: O(n^2) | SC: O(n)
# Method 2: dp by using dic_len
#   Time Complexity: O(n*U*L) Space: O(n)
#       U = how many different lengths appear in wordDict
#       L = the cost of slicing/ hashing s[j:i]


# Method 1
'''
Approach: Dynamic Programming
State: 
    dp[i] = True: if s[:i] can be segmented
Transitions:
    dp[i] = True if there exists j < i such that:
            dp[j] == True and s[j:i] in dict

* TC: O(n^2) | SC: O(n)
