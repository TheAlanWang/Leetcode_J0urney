# Greedy Algorithm
- **Greedy Algorithm** is a problem-solving strategy where:
    - At each step, you choose the *locally optimal* option (the best choice at that moment)
    - With the hope that this will lead to a globally optimal solution (best overall answer).

Solving Template:
1. Choice (local decision)
    - The action/decision you take at each step using only the info you have now

2. State (compact tracker)
    - The minimal variables that summarize all past info you need to make the next choice

3. Greedy update
    - The rule that immediately updates the state from the current choice so far, without backtracking.
